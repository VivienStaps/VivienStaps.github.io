# _First Post about Setting Up a Blog_
## GitHub, Jekyll

For setting up our own blog, we used _Jekyll_'s version on GitHub. Once we 'forked' it, we could have our own site. 
For posting a new post on the website, you have to insert a file into the _posts_ folder, but you have to make sure to correctly name it, e.g. 2023-04-32-hello-world-continues.md.
