# _Fourth Post about Data Analysis Methods_
## Network Analysis

Network analysis is the process of studying relationships between different components or elements in a complex system. This includes primarily analyzing social networks. The objective of network analysis is to
identify patterns in the way that these components are connected and to understand how changes to one component can affect the overall system. Network Analysis included a visual representation of the system that
is studied. 

## Text Analysis

Text analysis, also known as text mining or computational linguistics, is the process of extracting meaningful information and insights from a text or a collection of texts using statistical and machine
learning techniques. This includes analyzing the structure, content, and context of text data in order to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
We used [Voyant Tools](/ "https://voyant-tools.org/") for this.
