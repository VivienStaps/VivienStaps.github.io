# _Fourth Post about Data Analysis Methods_
## Network Analysis

Network analysis is the process of studying relationships between different components or elements in a complex system. This includes primarily analyzing social networks. The objective of network analysis is to
identify patterns in the way that these components are connected and to understand how changes to one component can affect the overall system. Network Analysis included a visual representation of the system that
is studied.
