# _First Post about Setting Up a Blog_
## GitHub, Jekyll

For setting up our own blog, we used _Jekyll_'s version on GitHub. Once we 'forked' it, we could have our own site. 
For posting a new post on the website, you have to insert a file into the _posts_ folder, but you have to make sure to correctly name it, e.g. 2023-04-32-hello-world-continues.md.

# _Second Post about Zotero_
## Zotero

Zotero is a database to store and manage your literature resources. You can sort them by name, date, title etc. and sort them into categories. 
The great benefit of Zotero is that you can install an Add-In into your writing program in order to simply search for the source you need, and Zotero automaticaly adds the right source in the citatiton format you want it to have. 
Also, there is the possibility to exporing citations into other formats.
