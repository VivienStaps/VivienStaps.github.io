# _Third Post about Online Collections_
## Online Collections

We looked at how to build an online collection via https://collectionbuilder.github.io/gh/. We went the same way as we did with creating a blog on the Jeykll-Git Hub, just with Collection Builder. 
We also looked at the difference in constructing tables in Excel, Google doc or LibreOffice. Next lesson we will build our very own online collection.
